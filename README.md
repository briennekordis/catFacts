# Project Title
Cat Facts

## Description
This project is built with React and fetches data from an API to produce a list of cat facts. 

## How to Use
Download or clone the files onto your local machine. Make sure that all files are saved in the same location and that you have Node installed. From your terminal, navigate to the directory of where these files live, run npm install and then npm start. A broswer should launch that displays instructions and a button to press to rener the cat facts. 

## Roadmap for Future Improvements
The data that is rendered is not as visually pleasing as it could be and so future improvements would be improved rendering and styling of the facts. 

## Licensing Information 
The API used for this app is from cat-facts: https://github.com/alexwohlbruck/cat-facts
